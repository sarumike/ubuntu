Setup users and access right
When you first have the machine, you'll be logged in as root. It is better to add a new user and allow access for this user to use the machine. 

First, create your user and password : 

add user and password
root@123.456.7.89$ adduser your_user_name
# Set password prompts:
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully
# User information prompts:
Changing the user information for username
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
    Full Name []:
    Room Number []:
    Work Phone []:
    Home Phone []:
    Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n]
You can add the admin right to this user, and start to switch to this user to work : 

switch user
root@123.456.7.89$ usermod -aG sudo your_user_name
root@123.456.7.89$ su - your_user_name
From now you use the machine as your username, you can start to create the ssh access right for this user by creating a file in your ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, enter your public ssh key there. As ssh is very severe about file permission, it's better to run a few set of commands :

set files permission
your_user_name@123.456.7.89$ chmod 700 ~/.ssh
your_user_name@123.456.7.89$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
your_user_name@123.456.7.89$ chown $USER:$USER ~/.ssh -R
Under admin right (sudo), open the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config, make sure the line containing AuthorizedKeysFile is uncommented, and contains %h/.ssh/authorized_keys. Then run sudo service ssh restart to restart ssh server.

After that, assuming you have the private ssh key, you can try to ssh-connect from your machine to this server.
